							<p class="about-me"> Hi! Thank you for visiting here, I am Jeo, a Criminologist. I graduated at Davao Oriental State University in Davao Oriental, Philippines. I had also passed the PRC licensure exam for criminologist in 2022.<br>
							<br>
							Beside from being a criminologist, I still never forget my hobbies and passion about graphic arts and technology as this was also one of my dream before, but unfortunately I was not able to get a chance to develop and enroll a course for it back then.<br>
							<br>
							Now, I created this website to begin learning about web developing and computer technology. I also made this to try building my first website at the same time.<br>
							<br>
							Over the past months, I have explored web development and the things about computer technology. I'm just beginning to learn my first web development language, HTML plus CSS and a very little idea about Javascript. Very far from what it needs to be, but I have tried my best to learn from this field through internet research, own understanding and practice. As we know, this is one of the trends and in-demand technical skills in this modern era that attracts many different jobs locally and internationally.<br>
							<br>
							As a self-taught student who studys about web developing, my endeavors have been rewarding, filled with countless hours of learning, trial and errors, and practicing. I have always been fascinated by the power of the internet and how the websites have the potential to connect people, share informations and build businesses.<br>
							<br> 
							Now, I am looking forward to growing and learning more in this field and hopefully I can integrate this skills in my career soon. 
							<br>
							<br>
							 -Jeo
